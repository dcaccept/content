Directory Structure and Naming Conventions
Welcome to the project repository! To ensure consistency and efficiency, please follow these guidelines for naming directories and files. This will help us maintain a well-organized and easily navigable structure.

Directory Structure
Root Directory (project_name)

All project-related documents and resources should be placed in the following main directories. Do not create additional top-level folders.
Main Directories

01_kbs/: Contains all knowledge-related documents.
02_onboarding_docs/: Includes onboarding and training materials.
03_access/: Manages access-related information and procedures.
04_showcase_items/: Stores important slides and showcase items.
05_dashboards/: Holds project dashboards and performance metrics.
06_data_files/: Central repository for data sets and backups.
Naming Conventions
Use Lower Case with Underscores

Folder and file names should be in lower case, separated by underscores (e.g., technical_documentation, new_hire_welcome_kit).
Avoid Special Characters

Use only letters, numbers, and underscores. Avoid spaces, hyphens, or special characters.
Be Descriptive and Specific

Use clear and descriptive names that reflect the content or purpose of the folder/file. Avoid generic names.
Do Not Create New Top-Level Folders

Stick to the provided main directories. Creating additional top-level folders can lead to confusion and disorganization.
Examples
Correct Naming
01_kbs/general_information/
02_onboarding_docs/role_specific_training/
03_access/access_requests/
04_showcase_items/important_slides/
05_dashboards/project_dashboards/
06_data_files/data_sets/
Incorrect Naming
01_KBS/ (Use underscores, not camel case or uppercase)
OnboardingDocs/ (Do not mix case)
Access Info/ (Avoid spaces and special characters)
Showcase/ (Be specific and avoid generic names)
Dashboards/Reports/ (Do not create subfolders at the top level)
DataSets/BackupFiles/ (Stick to the defined structure)
Additional Tips
Consistency is Key: Consistent naming helps everyone find and manage files efficiently.
Ask for Help: If youâ€™re unsure about the naming or structure, consult with a project lead or team member.
Thank you for following these guidelines. Your cooperation helps keep our project organized and accessible!
